##1.2 Let's talk about industrial growth.
You can't talk about it without fast fashion. Fast fashion is a term used to describe a highly profitable business model based on replicating catwalk trends and high-fashion designs, and mass-producing them at low cost.The term 'fast fashion' is also used to generically describe the products of the fast fashion business model.

Brands like Levi's, H&M have reached a consolidation point in their growth phase because new players like ZARA, Forever21, BOoHOO, Gap are now dominating the market using the fast fashion business model. How does it concern us ?

The pressure to reduce costs and speed up production time means that environmental corners are cut in the name of profit. Fast Fashion's negative impact includes the use of cheap, toxic textile dyes – with the fashion industry the second largest polluter of clean water globally after agriculture. Contributes to over 92 million tones of waste and 79 trillion liters of water consumed. The fashion industry currently uses enough water to quench the thirst of 110 million people for an entire year.

##1.3 The Statistics Of The Problem We Are Concerned With
“India, at present, generates the most waste globally, and that's expected to increase substantially by 2050 unless urgent measures are taken”. Every year, 2.01 billion tonnes of municipal waste is generated and India produces 277 million tonnes of it according to a 2016 estimate. That’s more than 80% of the 334 million tonnes of waste generated across South Asia and about 13% of the global waste generated every year. But India is among the lowest per capita generators of waste as a collective region, North America (Bermuda, Canada and the US) generates the most waste at 2.2kg per person per day, while Sub-Saharan African generates the least waste — 0.45kg per person per day. South Asia, which includes India, generates the second-least waste per day at 0.5kg per person. Bermuda tops in per person waste generation per day. India's figure is lower than the global average of 0.74kg.

##1.4 How Does ThreeAre's Helps?
ThreeAre's encourages their customers to join the drives which enforces sustainibility and renewability. To put emphasis on our ideals, we have introduced, the "Green Wallet". To purchase items from our store, customers would need to participate in drives, gather green points and redeem them. Not only that, green points can also be earned by funding our green drives and our goals! The objective of this project is to develop a general-purpose e-commerce store, Threeare’s where any product are sold , such as books, home appliances, clothing, accessories, bags, etc. which are exclusively manufactured from recycled substances. The motive is to empower the three R’s, reduce, reuse, recycle, where transactions take place through green points. An online store is a virtual store on the Internet where customers can browse the catalog and select products of interest. The selected items may be collected in a shopping cart. At checkout time, the items in the shopping cart will be presented as an order. At that time, more information will be needed to complete the transaction. Usually, the customer will be asked to fill or select a billing address, a shipping address, a shipping option, and payment information such as credit card number. An e- mail notification is sent to the customer as soon as the order is placed.

##1.6 How Do We Retain Our Users ?
There are two major approaches to gathering information in our project about the situation, person, problems or phenomenon and software about e-shopping. • Internal information • External Information This information was collected with the help of both primary and secondary resources. 1. a) Primary Data: They are collected by us on the concern topic, which are original. While studying, we have come across with the sources. 2. b) Secondary Data: They are collected by us on the basis of the study of internet websites, interviews with friends, etc.

##1.7 Limitations of the Project?
There are some limitations for the current system to which solutions can be provided as a future development: 
1. The system is not configured for multi- users at this time. The concept of transaction can be used to achieve this. 
2. The Website is not accessible to everyone. It can be deployed on a web server so that everybody who is connected to the Internet can use it. 
3. Credit Card validation is not done. Third party proprietary software can be used for validation check. As for other future developments, the following can be done: 
1. The Administrator of the web site can be given more functionality, like looking at a specific customer’s profile, the books that have to be reordered, etc. 
2. Multiple Shopping carts can be allowed Conclusion : 21st century is the hub of fast fashion. It also, unfortunately contributes to over 92 million tonnes of waste and 79 trillion liters of water consumed. It’s time to stop this madness. With ThreeAre’s not only do you help recycle the waste, you also considerably help reduce the carbon footprints. Not only do you help reduce carbon footprints but you also encourage reuse of products, increase their lifespan.
